> You know, whenever anybody asks Elon [Musk] how he learned to build rockets, he says, 'I read books.' Well, it's true. He devoured those books.  
~ Jim Cantrell, Aerospace consultant, on Elon Musk

## Why?
Reading books allows you to acquire in a few hours or days, the knowledge that the author a few _years_ to research, synthesise and collate.

dwyl has a good-sized collection of books on a variety of subjects, chiefly:
+ Programming
+ Business / startups
+ Psychology

We look to actively encourage dwylers to borrow and use these books
(see https://github.com/dwyl/summer/issues/31) but routinely run up against a few issues problems:
+ With no way of tracking who has borrowed these books, they are often forgotten and go missing (ontop of this we share an office space
where we don't have the contact details for those who are not dwylers)
+ It became clear from our previous attempts to capture key lessons and feedback
from the books that were read (by asking people to PR to
[this `md` file](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/master/books-to-read.md)),
that if this process is in any way onerous, it will not be done
and the knowledge will be lost
+ Current requests for books are verbal and we need a more efficient way of
capturing this so that we can automate the decision-making process

Preliminary research indicates that the current open source _library_ software that exists
is both complex and adheres to the rules that govern traditional _libraries_.
